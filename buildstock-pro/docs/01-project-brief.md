# BuildStock Pro - Project Brief

**Project:** Real-time Building Materials Aggregator for UK Builders
**Date:** January 28, 2026
**Status:** Phase 2 - Strategic Planning
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

BuildStock Pro is a materials price and stock agent for UK builders that combines real-time inventory visibility, instant price comparison, and location-based sorting into a single platform. Current solutions force builders to call 5-10 merchants or check multiple apps, wasting 2-5 hours per project. BuildStock Pro solves this by aggregating data from major UK merchants (Travis Perkins, Screwfix, Wickes, Jewson, Selco, etc.) and presenting results sorted by price, filtered by stock availability, and contextualized by distance.

**Target Market:** UK professional builders and tradespeople (850,000+ potential users)
**Revenue Opportunity:** £10-25M within 3 years
**Development Timeline:** 6-9 months to MVP
**Investment Required:** £325K (£75K validation + £250K MVP development)

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Core Problem

**UK professional builders waste 2-5 hours per week calling multiple merchants to check stock availability and compare prices for building materials.**

Current workflow pain points:
- **Fragmented Information:** Stock levels exist only in individual merchant apps or require phone calls
- **Price Opacity:** Trade pricing isn't comparable across merchants without multiple inquiries
- **Stock Uncertainty:** Finding materials "in stock" online doesn't guarantee availability at local branches
- **Time Waste:** Driving to multiple stores or waiting on hold delays projects and costs money
- **No Optimization:** Can't easily find "cheapest in-stock item within 10 miles"

### 1.2 Impact on Builders

**Time Cost:**
- 2-5 hours/week spent sourcing materials = 100-250 hours/year
- At £30/hour trade rate = £3,000-7,500/year in lost productivity
- For a team of 5 builders = £15,000-37,500/year in wasted time

**Project Delays:**
- Material shortages cause average 2-3 day delays per project
- Delay costs: £200-500/day in crew idle time + equipment rental
- Average project impacted: 2-3 times due to material issues

**Missed Savings:**
- Price variance across merchants: 10-20% for identical items
- Without comparison, builders overpay by 5-15% on materials
- Annual material spend: £50K-200K per builder = £2,500-30K in unnecessary costs

### 1.3 Why Current Solutions Fail

| Solution Type | Limitation |
|--------------|------------|
| **Individual Merchant Apps** | Walled gardens - must check 5-10 apps separately |
| **BuyMaterials.com** | Quote-based (not instant), no stock visibility |
| **Quote Me Goods** | Instant prices but no stock, no location context |
| **Material Network** | Real-time stock but limited merchant coverage, weak on price comparison |
| **Google/Manual Searches** | Time-consuming, inaccurate, not trade-specific |

**The Gap:** No single platform combines real-time stock + price comparison + location context.

## 2. Our Solution

### 2.1 BuildStock Pro Value Proposition

**"Find the cheapest in-stock building materials near you - in seconds, not hours."**

BuildStock Pro is a real-time aggregation platform that:
1. **Searches** across 20+ major UK merchants simultaneously
2. **Filters** to show only in-stock items at local branches
3. **Sorts** by price (cheapest to most expensive)
4. **Displays** distance, delivery options, and trade pricing
5. **Updates** data hourly to ensure accuracy

### 2.2 Core Features (MVP)

**Essential Features:**
- ✅ Material search (by name, category, brand, SKU)
- ✅ In-stock filter (hide out-of-stock items)
- ✅ Price sorting (cheapest to most expensive)
- ✅ Location context (merchant name, distance, delivery option)
- ✅ Real-time updates (hourly data refresh)
- ✅ Cross-platform (Web + iOS + Android)

**Differentiating Features:**
